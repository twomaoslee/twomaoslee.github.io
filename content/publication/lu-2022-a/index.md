abstract: 'The hidden symmetry of the asymmetric quantum Rabi model (AQRM) has recently
  been revealed via a systematic construction of the underlying symmetry operator.
  Based on the AQRM result, we propose an ansatz for the general form of the symmetry
  operators for AQRM-related models. Applying this ansatz we obtain the symmetry operator
  for three models: the anisotropic AQRM, the asymmetric Rabi--Stark model (ARSM),
  and the anisotropic ARSM.'
