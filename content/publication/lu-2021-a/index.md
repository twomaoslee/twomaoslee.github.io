abstract: 'The hidden Z$_2$ symmetry of the asymmetric quantum Rabi model (AQRM) has
  recently been revealed via a systematic construction of the underlying symmetry
  operator. Based on the AQRM result, we propose an ansatz for the general form of
  the symmetry operators for AQRM-related models. Applying this ansatz we obtain the
  symmetry operator for three models: the anisotropic AQRM, the asymmetric Rabi-Stark
  model (ARSM) and the anisotropic ARSM.'
